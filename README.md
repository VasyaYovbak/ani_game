## For players:

### Game description⚔️
__This is the game for two players with the main idea💡 to guess the anime, manga, comics hero.__

Initially🌞, you and your opponent have a board with cards and character card🃏; they are different for each player. A character card is one that your opponent has to guess🎲.
With each move, you withdraw cards from a board that you think🤔 is not the opponent's character card. You lose😢 in case your opponent guessed your card first, and you win🏆 in case you guessed the opponent's card first.

### Note📝
Be polite and respect your opponent, do not lie to your adversary and report any kind of abuse or dirty game to the support team.

We have no pity for violators of the rules of honor.🖊☠️📓
